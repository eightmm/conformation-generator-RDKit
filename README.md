# Conformation Generator

A Python tool for generating molecular conformations using RDKit's ETKDGv3 algorithm and optimizing them with UFF and MMFF force fields.

This project provides a simple and flexible way to generate multiple conformers of molecules, align them, optimize with different force fields, and output the results in SDF format with RMSD values for each conformer.

## Installation

1. First, clone the repository:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/conformation-generator.git
    cd conformation-generator
    \`\`\`

2. Install the required dependencies (RDKit):
    RDKit can be installed via conda:
    \`\`\`bash
    conda create -c conda-forge -n rdkit-env rdkit
    conda activate rdkit-env
    \`\`\`

3. If you're using another environment, ensure that RDKit and Python dependencies are properly installed.

## Usage

You can generate molecular conformations by running the \`generate_conformer.py\` script. 

### Basic Usage:
\`\`\`bash
python generate_conformer.py --sdf <input_sdf> --out <output_sdf> --num <number_of_conformers> --max_iter <max_iterations> --n_cpu <number_of_cpu> --verbose
\`\`\`

### Example:
\`\`\`bash
python generate_conformer.py --sdf example/molecule.sdf --out example/molecule_conf.sdf --num 100 --max_iter 200 --n_cpu 4 --verbose
\`\`\`

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Input**: The script accepts a molecule in SDF format (\`.sdf\`) as input.
2. **Conformer Generation**: It generates multiple conformers using the ETKDGv3 algorithm.
3. **Optimization**: Two force fields (UFF and MMFF) are applied to optimize the generated conformers.
4. **Alignment and RMSD Calculation**: The conformers are aligned, and the RMSD values for each conformer are computed.
5. **Output**: The results are saved in an SDF file with each conformer and its associated RMSD value.

## Example

This repository comes with an example directory that includes a sample molecule (\`molecule.sdf\`) and a sample run script (\`run.sh\`). 

To try it out, simply run:

\`\`\`bash
cd example
bash run.sh
\`\`\`

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what happens:
- The script reads the input molecule from \`molecule.sdf\`.
- It generates 100 conformers of the molecule.
- UFF and MMFF optimizations are applied.
- Conformers are aligned and written to \`molecule_conf.sdf\`, with the RMSD values stored in each conformer entry.

---

## Output

The output will be an SDF file containing:
- All the generated conformers.
- RMSD values for each conformer, calculated based on the alignment with the reference conformer.

Each conformer in the output SDF file will have a property named \`RMSD\` that indicates how far it is (in terms of RMSD) from the first conformer. This allows you to easily assess the diversity of the generated conformations.
